  abstract = {An analysis of the Functional Imaging Analysis Contest (FIAC) data
	is presented using spatial wavelet processing. This technique allows
	the image to be filtered adaptively according to the data itself,
	rather than relying on a predetermined filter. This adaptive filtering
	leads to better estimation of the parameters and contrasts in terms
	of mean squared error. It will be shown that by introducing a slight
	bias into the estimation, a large reduction in the variance can be
	achieved, leading to better overall mean squared error estimates.
	As no single filter needs to be preselected, results containing many
	scales of information can be found. In the FIAC data, it is shown
	that both small-scale and large-scale (smoother, more dispersed)
	effects occur. The combination of small- and large-scale effects
	detected in the FIAC data would be easy to miss using conventional
	single filter analysis.},

  abstract = {Threat-related stimuli are strong competitors for attention, particularly
	in anxious individuals. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(fMRI) with healthy human volunteers to study how the processing
	of threat-related distractors is controlled and whether this alters
	as anxiety levels increase. Our work builds upon prior analyses of
	the cognitive control functions of lateral prefrontal cortex (lateral
	PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We found that rostral ACC
	was strongly activated by infrequent threat-related distractors,
	consistent with a role for this area in responding to unexpected
	processing conflict caused by salient emotional stimuli. Participants
	with higher anxiety levels showed both less rostral ACC activity
	overall and reduced recruitment of lateral PFC as expectancy of threat-related
	distractors was established. This supports the proposal that anxiety
	is associated with reduced top-down control over threat-related distractors.
	Our results suggest distinct roles for rostral ACC and lateral PFC
	in governing the processing of task-irrelevant, threat-related stimuli,
	and indicate reduced recruitment of this circuitry in anxiety.},

  abstract = {In studies of patients with focal brain lesions, it is often useful
	to coregister an image of the patient's brain to that of another
	subject or a standard template. We refer to this process as spatial
	normalization. Spatial normalization can improve the presentation
	and analysis of lesion location in neuropsychological studies; it
	can also allow other data, for example from functional imaging, to
	be compared to data from other patients or normal controls. In functional
	imaging, the standard procedure for spatial normalization is to use
	an automated algorithm, which minimizes a measure of difference between
	image and template, based on image intensity values. These algorithms
	usually optimize both linear (translations, rotations, zooms, and
	shears) and nonlinear transforms. In the presence of a focal lesion,
	automated algorithms attempt to reduce image mismatch between template
	and image at the site of the lesion. This can lead to significant
	inappropriate image distortion, especially when nonlinear transforms
	are used. One solution is to use cost-function masking-masking the
	areas used in the calculation of image difference-to exclude the
	area of the lesion, so that the lesion does not bias the transformations.
	We introduce and evaluate this technique using normalizations of
	a selection of brains with focal lesions and normal brains with simulated
	lesions. Our results suggest that cost-function masking is superior
	to the standard approach to this problem, which is affine-only normalization;
	we propose that cost-function masking should be used routinely for
	normalizations of brains with focal lesions.},

  abstract = {When a head is placed in an MRI scanner, differences between the magnetic
	susceptibility of tissue, bone, and air distort the magnetic field.
	While some of the resulting inhomogeneity can be corrected by the
	shimming process, much of it cannot, and this causes distortion (sometimes
	referred to as geometric distortion) of echo-planar images (EPIs).
	One strategy for the correction of distortion is to acquire a map
	of the magnetic field achieved in each subject and then to use this
	to undistort their EPIs after reconstruction (). Here, we present
	five experiments to evaluate the application of such a strategy on
	data from a 3-T scanner. We show that after undistortion, the shape
	of EPIs is more similar to the true shape of the brain, and we investigate
	the effect of head movement on the efficacy of undistortion. If undistortion
	was applied first, it was found that less nonlinear warping was required
	to transform EPIs into a standard space, particularly in the phase-encode
	direction. We show that if SPM 99 normalization is used to perform
	a nonlinear warp to standard space, the prior application of undistortion
	increases the statistical power of group studies with motor and auditory
	tasks. We show that this increase in power is due to an increase
	in the overlap of activation of different subjects. Finally, we evaluate
	where in the brain undistorting EPIs might be expected to have the
	greatesteffect, in terms both of mislocalization of activationand
	of a reduction in power. Overall, undistorting EPIs using field maps
	has proved extremely successful, improving the anatomical localization
	of activation and increasing statistical power.},

	facts (ABM-SEM) in 24 subjects across three PET studies revealed
	bilateral involvement of the middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) and medial

	in increased regional cerebral blood flow in left posterior temporal
	regions (BA 37) and left prefrontal cortex (BA 45/46). Laterality
	maps suggest that the bilateral pattern seen in our studies, but
	not often in other neuroimaging investigations, reflects the use
	of a task stressing retrieval of specific personal events. Further
	comparisons revealed that the activation in the right anterior temporal
	lobe during autobiographical recall was virtually identical to that
	seen during retrieval of information about famous people or events
	in contrast with retrieval of general semantic facts. These findings
	suggest that the retrieval of an autobiographical event requires

  abstract = {Humans often synchronize movements to the beat, indicating that motor
	areas may be involved in detecting or generating a beat. The basal
	ganglia have been shown to be preferentially activated by perception
	of rhythms with a regular beat (Grahn and Brett, 2007), but their
	necessity for beat-based rhythm processing has not been proven. Previous
	research has shown that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are impaired
	in timing of isochronous intervals (Harrington et al., 1998a; O'Boyle
	et al., 1996), but little work has tested more complex rhythms. In
	healthy volunteers, behavioural performance is better for rhythms
	with a beat than without a beat (Essens, 1986). We tested PD patients
	and controls on a rhythm discrimination task to determine if basal
	ganglia dysfunction results in an impairment of processing rhythms
	that have a beat. Unlike rhythm reproduction, discrimination has
	no motor requirements that are problematic for patients. Half the
	rhythms had a beat-based structure, and half did not. Subjects heard
	a rhythm twice and then indicated if a third presentation of the
	rhythm was the same or different. We predicted that PD patients would
	benefit less from beat structure than controls, resulting in a group
	by rhythm-type interaction, with reduced relative performance for
	the beat-based sequences in the PD group. Indeed this was the pattern
	of the results. In the control group, a significant advantage was
	observed for discrimination of rhythms with a beat compared to those
	without a beat. This advantage was greatly reduced in the PD group.
	Discrimination of beat-based rhythms was significantly impaired in
	PD patients compared to controls, whereas discrimination of non-beat-based
	rhythms did not differ significantly. This suggests that the basal
	ganglia are part of a system involved in detecting or generating
	an internal beat, and that this system is compromised in patients
	with Parkinson's disease.},

	in response to both explicit and implicit retrieval of knowledge
	about actions associated with manipulable tools. Function judgments

	a minimum statistic test for conjunction. We refer to this method
	as the minimum statistic compared to the global null (MS/GN). The
	MS/GN is implemented in SPM2 and SPM99 software, and has been widely
	used as a test of conjunction. However, we assert that it does not
	have the correct null hypothesis for a test of logical AND, and further,
	this has led to confusion in the neuroimaging community. In this
	paper, we define a conjunction and explain the problem with the MS/GN
	test as a conjunction method. We present a survey of recent practice
	in neuroimaging which reveals that the MS/GN test is very often misinterpreted
	as evidence of a logical AND. We show that a correct test for a logical
	AND requires that all the comparisons in the conjunction are individually
	significant. This result holds even if the comparisons are not independent.
	We suggest that the revised test proposed here is the appropriate

  abstract = {Numerous functionally distinct regions of cortex (e.g., V1, MT, the
	fusiform face area) can be easily identified in any normal human
	subject in just a few minutes of fMRI scanning. However, the locations
	of these regions vary across subjects. Investigations of these regions
	have therefore often used a functional region of interest (fROI)
	approach in which the region is first identified functionally in
	each subject individually, before subsequent scans in the same subjects
	test specific hypotheses concerning that region. This fROI method,
	which resembled long-established practice in visual neurophysiology,
	has methodological, statistical, and theoretical advantages over
	standard alternatives (such as whole-brain analyses of group data):
	(i) because functional properties are more consistently and robustly
	associated with fROIs than with locations in stereotaxic space, functional
	hypotheses concerning fROIs are often the most straightforward to
	frame, motivate, and test, (ii) because hypotheses are tested in
	only a handful of fROIs (instead of in tens of thousands of voxels),
	advance specification of fROIs provides a massive increase in statistical
	power over whole-brain analyses, and (iii) some fROIs may serve as
	candidate distinct components of the mind/brain worth investigation
	as such. Of course fROIs can be productively used in conjunction
	with other complementary methods. Here, we explain the motivation
	for and advantages of the fROI approach, and we rebut the criticism
	of this method offered by Friston et al. (Friston, K., Rotshtein,
	P., Geng, J., Sterzer, P., Henson, R., in press. A critique of functional
	localizers. NeuroImage).},

  abstract = {FMRI studies of the orbitofrontal cortex or the inferior temporal
	lobes are often compromised by susceptibility artefacts, which may
	result in signal reduction or loss in gradient echo (GE) EPI. Spin
	echo (SE) EPI is considerably more robust against susceptibility-related
	signal loss, but its intrinsic sensitivity to changes in the blood
	oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast is generally lower. In
	this study, we performed a direct comparison of GE and SE fMRI using
	a single-shot dual echo EPI acquisition scheme. Transient hypercapnia,
	induced by breathing Carbogen (5\% CO(2), 95\% O(2)), was used as
	a global physiological stimulus to alter the BOLD contrast. In regions
	affected by magnetic field inhomogeneities, SE EPI provided significantly
	higher BOLD sensitivity than GE EPI. Such regions included the orbitofrontal
	cortex, temporal pole, anterior inferior temporal cortex, as well
	as parts of the lateral inferior temporal cortex and the lateral
	cerebellum. Dual echo fMRI benefits from the robustness of SE EPI
	in these critical regions while utilising the generally higher sensitivity
	of GE EPI in normal regions. It therefore provides an attractive
	solution for fMRI studies that require optimum sensitivity in both
	normal and critical brain regions. Furthermore, a general method
	is proposed to combine the GE and SE data into a single hybrid data
	set that provides optimum sensitivity in the whole brain. This method
	can be applied to any experimental design that can be expressed in
	terms of a generalised linear model. The feasibility of this approach
	is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally.},

  abstract = {Individuals with cerebellar lesions are impaired in the timing of
	repetitive movements that involve the concatenation of discrete events
	such as tapping a finger. In contrast, these individuals perform
	comparably to controls when producing continuous repetitive movements.
	Based on this, we have proposed that the cerebellum plays a key role
	in event timing-the representation of the temporal relationship between
	salient events related to the movement (e.g., flexion onset or contact
	with a response surface). In the current study, we used fMRI to examine
	cerebellar activity during discrete and continuous rhythmic movements.
	Participants produced rhythmic movements with the index finger either
	making smooth, continuous transitions between flexion and extension
	or with a pause inserted before each flexion phase making the movement
	discrete. Lateral regions in lobule VI, ipsilateral to the moving
	hand were activated in a similar manner for both conditions. However,
	activation in the superior vermis was significantly greater when
	the movements were discrete compared to when the movements were continuous.
	This pattern was not evident in cortical regions within the field
	of view, including M1 and SMA. The results are consistent with the
	hypothesis that subregions of the cerebellum are selectively engaged
	during tasks involving event timing.},

	(ANOVA, ANCOVA and other linear models) are applied not directly
	on images but on their correspondent wavelet transforms. Maps of
	model effects estimated from these models are filtered using a thresholding
	procedure based on a simple Bonferroni correction and then reconstructed.
	This procedure inherently represents a complete modeling approach
	and therefore obtains estimates of the effects of interest (condition
	effect, difference between conditions, covariate of interest, and
	so on) under the specified statistical risk. By performing the statistical
	modeling step in wavelet space. the procedure allows the direct estimation
	of the error for each wavelet coefficient; hence, the local noise
	characteristics are accounted for in the subsequent filtering. The
	method was validated by use of a null dataset and then applied to
	typical examples of neuroimaging studies to highlight conceptual
	and practical differences from existing statistical parametric mapping
	approaches.},

	of the problem of estimation addresses the equivalent problems of

	In particular, new theory and algorithms are presented that allow
	current wavelet methodology to deal with the two main characteristics
	of nuclear medicine images: low signal-to-noise ratios and correlated
	noise. The technique is applied to synthetic images, phantom studies,
	and clinical images. Results show the ability of wavelets to model
	images and to estimate the signal generated by cameras of different
	resolutions in a wide variety of noise conditions. Moreover, the
	same methodology can be used for the multiscale analysis of statistical
	maps. The relationship of the wavelet approach to current hypothesis-testing
	methods is shown with an example and discussed. The wavelet transform
	is shown to be a valuable tool for the numerical treatment of images
	in nuclear medicine. It is envisaged that the methods described here
	may be a starting point for further developments in image reconstruction
